AI Summarizer App

 Overview

AISummarizerApp is a lightweight, AI-powered tool that generates concise summaries from large blocks of text or articles. Built using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this application leverages AI to understand and extract key points from lengthy text, making it an ideal tool for quickly grasping the core ideas of articles, research papers, or documents.

This project is designed as a practice application, allowing developers to understand how to integrate AI models into web-based applications, offering a solid foundation to build more advanced text-processing tools.

Features

  Text Summarization: 
  - Automatically generates a concise summary of any given input text using AI algorithms.
  
  Input Formats(article link): 
  - Supports URL links to articles for summarization.
  
  Customizable Summary Length: 
  - Allows users to specify the desired length of the summary (short, medium, long).
  

  Interactive Web Interface:
  - Easy-to-use front-end for users to paste text, provide URLs, or upload documents for instant summarization.

  API Support (Rapid Api):
  - Provides a REST API for developers to integrate summarization features into other applications.

  Tech Stack

- Backend**: [Node.js, React, etc.]
- Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or any frontend framework like React)


 Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AISummarizerApp.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd AISummarizerApp
   npm install   # or pip install -r requirements.txt if using Python
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file with necessary API keys and configuration:
   ```bash
   AI_API_KEY=your_openai_or_transformer_api_key
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start   # or python app.py for Python projects
   ```

5. Access the web interface:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the relevant port) to start using the summarizer.



Usage

Once the application is running, you can provide a URL to summarize content directly from the web interface. For developers, the API can be used to integrate summarization into other tools or services.
